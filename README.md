# calendar-sync
A script to sync your events between your personal calendar and your work calendar.

I borrowed this code from [@ttrahan](https://gist.github.com/ttrahan/a88febc0538315b05346f4e3b35997f2) with a few fixes for Private events.

Everything else should work the same way that he documented it.
